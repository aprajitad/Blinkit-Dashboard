📌 Project Title: Blinkit Dashboard
📝 Problem Statement

Blinkit (formerly Grofers) generates vast amounts of sales and delivery data across different regions. However, raw data in spreadsheets is difficult to interpret and analyze directly. Business stakeholders need a visual, interactive dashboard to:

Track real-time delivery performance.

Analyze customer behavior and purchasing patterns.

Identify areas for operational improvements.

Support decision-making with clear KPIs.

This project aims to build a Power BI dashboard to visualize Blinkit’s operations and generate insights.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess Blinkit dataset for analysis.

Build KPIs to measure delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Create interactive dashboards for better insights.

Provide data-driven recommendations to improve performance.

📊 Features of the Dashboard

Delivery Metrics: Average delivery time, late vs on-time deliveries.

Sales Insights: Regional sales trends, top-selling products.

Customer Behavior: Average order size, repeat vs new customers.

Geographic Trends: Region-wise performance comparison.

Interactive Filters: Region, product category, and time filters.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Power Query

📈 Insights & Recommendations

* Delivery delays are most common in high-order volume regions, suggesting a need for better workforce allocation.
